**Project Overview:**

Driven by a strong interest in both music and data analysis, this project aims to explore the question:

**What Makes Music Attractive to Listeners?**

Using data from a user's Spotify listening history, this project analyses how low-level musical features, like tempo, energy, danceability and valence, affect listener engagement. This is approximated using Spotify's popularity metric, under the assumption that greater popularity reflects greater user engagement on aggregate.

Through data analysis, visualisation and modelling, the project should be able to identify which musical features are most strongly associated with popular music, and to assess how well these features can justify user listening preferences.
