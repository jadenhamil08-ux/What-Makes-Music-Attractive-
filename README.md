## **Project Overview:**

Driven by a strong interest in both music and data analysis, I have created a project that explores the question:

**What Makes Music Attractive to Listeners?**

Using data from a user's Spotify listening history, this project analyses how low-level musical features, like tempo, energy, danceability and valence, affect listener engagement. This is approximated using Spotify's popularity metric, under the assumption that greater popularity reflects greater user engagement on aggregate.

Through data analysis, visualisation and modelling, this project aims to identify which musical features are most strongly associated with popular music, and to assess how well these features can justify user listening preferences. 

## **Research Questions:**

Here listed below, are a list of questions that will be the focus points of my project, which I should be able to answer at the end.

Primary Question - What musical features are most strongly associated with listener attraction in popular music?

Secondary Questions:
- Which features are consistently more important than others?
- Do highly popular tracks exhibit distinct feature distributions compared to less popular tracks?
- Do the features associated with popularity vary across genres?
- How closely do user listening preferences align with global popularity trends?
- What are the limitations of modelling musical attraction with audio features alone?
